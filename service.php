Fly healthy, fly fit:</h1><br>

Deepak Chopra’s travel tips-<br>
Deepak Chopra is a best-selling author and the co-founder of The Chopra Centre for Wellbeing in Southern California.<br>
Drink plenty of water: Flying dehydrates the body, leaving you tired and irritable.<br>
Meditate during your flight: Taking deep breaths will help to calm your mind.<br>
Avoid alcohol and caffeine: These are both extremely dehydrating at high altitudes.<br>
Eat relatively lightly: Aid digestion by getting up and doing some stretches after your meal.<br>
Start a thought journal: If your mind is very active, take a few minutes to write your thoughts in a journal or notebook.</li>
